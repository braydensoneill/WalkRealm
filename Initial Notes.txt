WalkRealm

--------

CORE IDEA

- A location-based walking game focused on persistent trails, and competitive realm control
- Walking in the real world leaves permanent marks on a shared map
- Users compete by claiming space over time
- Score is earned daily by 'ruling' a greater area (realm) every day

--------

GAME LOOP

- User opens the app
- App tracks location while walking
- A trail is drawn behind the user
- Trail becomes permanently claimed
- Claimed trails contribute to realm control
- Realm rulers earn daily score
- Score feeds long-term progression and status

--------

TRAILS

- Trails are drawn as the user walks
- Approximate width: 10m
- Trails are persistent but fade over time
- Trails contribute to realm ownership but do not stack infinitely for score

--------

Realms

- The world is divided into fixed grid cells (e.g. 50m x 50m)
- Trails claim cells they pass through
- A realm is a larger grouping of cells (e.g. 500m x 500m)
- Owned by a ruler

--------

RULER RULES

- The ruler is the user who controls the most cells in that realm
- Ruler earn 1 score per realm per day
- Score is granted only if the user is still ruler at the daily cutoff
- Daily cutoff happens randomly every day (with heads up?) - See how BeReal does it
- Realms must meet a minimum activity threshold to generate score
