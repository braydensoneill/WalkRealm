WalkRealm

--------

CORE IDEA

- A location-based walking game focused on persistent trails, and competitive territorial control
- Walking in the real world leaves permanent marks on a shared map
- Players compete by claiming space over time
- Score is earned daily by 'ruling' a greater area (realm) every day

--------

GAME LOOP

- Player opens the app
- App tracks location while walking
- A trail is drawn behind the player
- Trail becomes permanently claimed
- Claimed trails contribute to territory control
- Realm rulers earn daily score
- Score feeds long-term progression and status

--------

TRAILS

- Trails are drawn as the user walks
- Approximate width: 10m
- Trails are persistent but fade over time
- Trails contribute to territorial ownership but do not stack infinitely for score

--------

TERRITORIES

- The world is divided into fixed grid cells (e.g. 50m x 50m)
- Trails claim cells they pass through
- A territory is a larger grouping of cells (e.g. 500m x 500m)
